-- Android shopping list  demo --

This is a small shopping list app demo.

The idea is that when I run out of something I just mark it as "not available" 
then after I go to the grocery store I check it again as available.

Whenever an item is marked as available or not the status is saved in the local db immediatly

Features :

- Listview with items using a custom viewgroup 
- Touch gestures (switch toggle using a fling gesture)
- SQLite DB
